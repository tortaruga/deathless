            <p class="about__paragraph">In his story 'The Silence of the Sirens', Kafka retells the episode of Ulysses and the mermaids: he writes that when they saw him tied to the ship-mast, with wax in his ears and his eyes radiant, they forgot to sing. They stared after him with their hair flowing in the wind and their expressions enraptured, petrified and voiceless.</p>

          <div class="about__container">
            <p class="about__paragraph">He writes that the silence of the siren is deadlier than her song: that no mortal could ever feel the blazing pride of his victory over a mermaidâ€”his victory over fateâ€”and not be consumed whole.</p>

          </div>
    
          <div class="about__container">
            <p class="about__paragraph">We beg to differ. We believe the silence of a siren to be deadlier than her voice because no mortal creature could ever endure not to hear something so sublime that it annihilates death. To see her cruel unshifting eyes, her sealed lips, to know she sang for othersâ€”but not for you. For you her tongue is silent. For you her song is dead. For you she will not sing.</p>  
            <svg class="scroll-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="rgb(195, 190, 202)"  stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M7 13l5 5 5-5M7 6l5 5 5-5"/></svg>
          </div>
    
          <div class="about__container">
            <p class="about__paragraph">We think that if Ulysses had heard that silenceâ€”if he had known how they had refused him that spell that seizes the heart, he would have gone mad. He would have begged, please, please, torture me with your song, rip me off myself and call me to your sweet oblivion, grant me one mere second of immortality, for to die with your voice in my ears is to know no death at all. He would have crushed his skull against the rocks for the unbearable weight of that silence, the impossible stillness of an echo that refuses to answer back.</p>

            <p class="about__paragraph">In one single note death will be obliterated. For one perfect, tiny moment that will stretch into eternity, the last moment before the waves welcome you home, you will be deathless.</p>
